1. Write a Java class Student that has multiple constructors. One constructor should accept 
student name and ID, while another should accept student name, ID, and grades. Implement 
constructor overloading and ensure the constructors call each other using this().

2. Create a class Employee with fields name, id, designation, and salary. Implement 
multiple constructors that initialize different combinations of these fields, and ensure that they 
chain to a primary constructor using the this() keyword.

3. Design a class ComplexNumber that models complex numbers. Write a copy constructor that 
takes another ComplexNumber object and initializes the current object’s real and imaginary 
parts with the copied values. 

4. Implement a singleton class DatabaseConnection using a private constructor. Ensure that 
the class restricts object creation to only one instance and provides a global access point using a 
static method.

5. Write an abstract class Shape that has a parameterized constructor to initialize the color of the 
shape. Extend this class in Circle and Rectangle, which will have their own additional 
parameters (like radius, length, width). Ensure proper constructor calls using super().

6. Implement a class Polynomial that models a polynomial equation. Use a constructor that 
takes a variable number of coefficients (using varargs) and initializes the polynomial. Write a 
method to display the polynomial in a readable format (e.g., 3x^2 + 2x + 1).

7. Create an interface Shape that has methods double area() and double perimeter()
 . Implement this interface in two classes: Circle and Rectangle. The Circle class should 
calculate the area and perimeter using the radius, and the Rectangle class should use the 
length and width.

8. Create two interfaces Flying and Swimming, each with a method void fly() and void 
swim() respectively. Create a class Duck that implements both interfaces and overrides both 
methods. Write a test class that demonstrates the Duck's ability to both fly and swim.

9. Create an interface PaymentMethod with a method void pay(double amount). 
Implement this interface in two classes: CreditCardPayment and PayPalPayment. 
Write a class OnlineStore that accepts a PaymentMethod in its constructor and uses it to 
process a payment
