NOTE: Do not use any inbuilt methods

1. Write a method that takes an integer array as input and returns a new array 
with the elements in reverse order.
2. Create a method that accepts an array of integers and returns the maximum 
and minimum values found in the array.
3. Write a method that checks if there are any duplicate elements in an integer 
array. Return true if duplicates exist, otherwise return false.
4. Create a method that merges two sorted integer arrays into a single sorted 
array.
5. Write a method that rotates an array to the right by a given number of steps.
6. Write a method that checks whether a given string is a palindrome (reads 
the same forwards and backwards).
7. Create a method that counts the number of vowels and consonants in a 
given string.
8. Write a method that reverses the characters in a given string.
9. Create a method that returns the first non-repeated character in a string. If 
there are no non-repeated characters, return a special value (like null).
10. Write a method that checks whether two strings are anagrams of each 
other (contain the same characters in a different order).
11. Create a method that counts how many times a given substring 
appears in a string.
